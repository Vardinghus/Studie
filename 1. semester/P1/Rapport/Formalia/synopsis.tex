This paper deals with the problem of ever growing resolutions, and therefore file sizes, of images taken with cameras on mobile phones. It examines two different signal processing techniques, which both detect correlation between values in an input signal, in the process of creating two different image compression algorithms. The two techniques are; a Discrete Cosine Transform and Principal Component Analysis. This paper will account for the mathematical properties of each of the techniques, incorporate them into image compression algorithms, and evaluate each algorithm by comparing quality and compression ratio of various test images for each algorithm. Through this comparison this paper determines which of the two is best suited as an image compression program for images taken with a mobile phone. This paper concludes, that the algorithm based on the Discrete Cosine Transform is more efficient at compressing images than the algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis, and it is therefore more suited as an image compression program for mobile phones.
